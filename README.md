# Project: Neighbourhood Maps  - Savneet Singh

README for running the Neighbourhood Maps project which makes use of the Google Maps API.

## Contents of project
This project contains:
* An `index.html` file (this is used to run the application)
* An `app.js` file (contains Knockout and MVM)
* An `images folder` containing the hamburger icon
* A `library folder` containing the Knockout-3.2.0.js file 
* A `style.css` file that contains the css styles


## How to run the project

* Clone the git repository and run `index.html` by double clicking the file in the folder structure
* This applciaiton contains a location filter which can be hidden to show only the map. To show or hide the filter click on the blue hamburger icon
* The application is also responsive so will retain it's functionality and feel on different sized screens

## Third-party resources
I used the Wikimedia API to get the wikipedia pages for each location. These were added to the info windows.
Note not all locations will have wikipedia pages, so not all info windows will show links.
